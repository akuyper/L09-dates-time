## Overview

The goal of this lab is to learn and understand how to work with dates and times in R (which is surprisingly complex). The `lubridate` package makes it easier to work with dates and times within R in an intuitive framework with methods that can handle time zones, leap days, daylight savings times, and other issues related to time. It is part of the core `tidyverse` packages.

-   [`lubridate` vignette (highly recommend)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html)

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L09_dates_times.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `Lastname_Firstname_L09.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
